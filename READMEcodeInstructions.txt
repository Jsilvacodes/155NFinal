HOW TO USE THE CODE:
You can call the function Finalproject with no inputs and no outputs. In the GUI, input your matrix in the form 
ROW 1 ; ROW 2 ; ... ; ROW n. Please only use square matrices, and matrices with real eigenvalues.
Non-square matrices will produce an error, and imaginary eigenvalues will not plot on the graph. 
You can click off the text box or hit enter to see your matrix in matrix form. Clicking the 
SOLVE button will produce the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in matrix form, and graph the vectors in either a 2-D or 3-D graph.
